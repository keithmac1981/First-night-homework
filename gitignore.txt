What is git ignore:

* used to ensure files not already tracked in git remain untracked

* makes it easier if you have lots of files but don't want to show them all
 when you run git status

 * aids readability for you and anyone who might work on your files by hiding 
  non relevant files that may be in your directory

  * use git rm --cached. to stop tracking files
